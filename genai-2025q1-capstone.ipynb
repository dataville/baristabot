This function retrieves and formats the entire cafe menu in a readable format.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Function Decoration**:\n   - The `@tool` decorator makes this function available to the LLM as a named tool that can be invoked during conversation\n\n2. **Vector Database Query**:\n   - `retriever = menu_db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 10})` creates a retriever that will return up to 10 matching documents\n   - `docs = retriever.invoke(\"all menu categories\")` queries the database for menu items across all categories\n\n3. **Menu Organization**:\n   - The function initializes an empty dictionary to group menu items by category\n   - It iterates through each retrieved document and organizes them by their category metadata\n   - If a category doesn't exist in the dictionary yet, it creates a new list for that category\n\n4. **Menu Formatting**:\n   - The function builds a well-formatted string containing the entire menu\n   - Items are grouped by category, making the menu easier to read and understand\n   - Each category's items are joined with newlines and separated by blank lines\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nThis function serves as the BaristaBot's knowledge source for the complete menu, allowing it to:\n* Provide customers with the full menu when requested\n* Answer general questions about what's available\n* Stay up-to-date with menu changes (as the vector database can be updated)\n* Present menu information in a structured, user-friendly format\n\nWhen a customer asks something like \"What do you have?\" or \"Can I see the menu?\", the LLM can call this function to retrieve the complete, organized menu to share with the customer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"@tool\ndef get_menu() -> str:\n    \"\"\"Provide the latest up-to-date menu from our menu database.\"\"\"\n    # Get all menu categories\n    retriever = menu_db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 10})\n    # Use invoke instead of get_relevant_documents\n    docs = retriever.invoke(\"all menu categories\")\n    \n    # Build a formatted menu from retrieved documents\n    menu_text = \"MENU:\\n\"\n    \n    # Group documents by category\n    categories = {}\n    for doc in docs:\n        category = doc.metadata.get(\"category\", \"Other\")\n        if category not in categories:\n            categories[category] = []\n        categories[category].append(doc.page_content)\n    \n    # Format the menu\n    for category, items in categories.items():\n        menu_text += \"\\n\".join(items) + \"\\n\\n\"\n        \n    return menu_text","metadata":{"id":"hG1n6mNFHsYW","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T05:27:06.312423Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T05:27:06.312837Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T05:27:06.326630Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-18T05:27:06.312802Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T05:27:06.325350Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The search_menu Tool Function Explained\n\nThis function creates a specialized menu search capability that lets the BaristaBot find specific information:\n\n### Function Purpose\nWhile `get_menu()` retrieves the entire menu, `search_menu()` allows for targeted searches to answer specific customer questions about menu items, ingredients, or options.\n\n### Key Components\n1. **Tool Registration**:\n   - The `@tool` decorator registers this function as a tool that the LLM can invoke during conversations\n   - The function signature shows it takes a string query and returns a string result\n\n2. **Focused Retrieval**:\n   - `retriever = menu_db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 3})` creates a retriever limited to the 3 most relevant results\n   - This prevents overwhelming customers with too much information\n\n3. **Semantic Search**:\n   - `docs = retriever.invoke(query)` performs a semantic search using the query string\n   - This allows natural language questions like \"What milk options do you have?\" or \"Tell me about your lattes\"\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - The function handles the case where no relevant information is found\n   - It returns a clear message stating nothing was found for the query\n\n5. **Result Formatting**:\n   - The function formats the results with a clear header\n   -

It examines the last message and routes to the appropriate node based on the message content and order status.\n\n## Routing Logic Breakdown\n1. **Initial Validation**\n   - Checks if messages exist in the state\n   - Raises an error if no messages are found\n   - Retrieves the last message for analysis\n\n2. **Exit Condition Check**\n   - Checks if the order has been completed (state.finished is True)\n   - Returns the special END constant to terminate the conversation\n   - Relies on the AI's system instructions to provide a proper goodbye message\n\n3. **Tool Call Detection**\n   - Checks if the message contains tool calls (AI requesting to use tools)\n   - Distinguishes between two types of tools:\n     - Automated tools (menu-related): Routes to the \"tools\" node\n     - Order management tools: Routes to the \"ordering\" node\n   - This separation allows different handling for information retrieval vs. state-changing operations\n\n4. **Default Human Interaction**\n   - If no special routing is needed, routes to the \"human\" node\n   - This allows the human user to respond to the AI's message\n\n## In the LangGraph Context\nThis function is used as a conditional edge in the state graph. The dynamic routing creates a conversation flow that allows BaristaBot to:\n- Retrieve menu information when needed\n- Manage the order state properly\n- Interact with the user naturally\n- Exit gracefully when the order is complete\n\nThis routing mechanism enables the conversation to flow naturally between different components while maintaining appropriate state transitions throughout the ordering process.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def maybe_route_to_tools(state: OrderState) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Route between chat and tool nodes if a tool call is made.\"\"\"\n    if not (msgs := state.get(\"messages\", [])):\n        raise ValueError(f\"No messages found when parsing state: {state}\")\n\n    msg = msgs[-1]\n\n    if state.get(\"finished\", False):\n        # When an order is placed, exit the app. The system instruction indicates\n        # that the chatbot should say thanks and goodbye at this point, so we can exit\n        # cleanly.\n        return END\n\n    elif hasattr(msg, \"tool_calls\") and len(msg.tool_calls) > 0:\n        # Route to `tools` node for any automated tool calls first.\n        if any(\n            tool[\"name\"] in tool_node.tools_by_name.keys() for tool in msg.tool_calls\n        ):\n            return \"tools\"\n        else:\n            return \"ordering\"\n\n    else:\n        return \"human\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T05:27:24.976126Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T05:27:24.977191Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T05:27:24.983756Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-18T05:27:24.977149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T05:27:24.982533Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The chatbot_with_tools Function: Core LLM Interaction Node\n\n## Function Purpose\nThis function serves as the primary interaction point with the language model in the BaristaBot conversation system.
